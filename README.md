# React Tailwind Layout

This project demonstrates a simple React layout styled with Tailwind CSS. It features a sticky header with a button that toggles between **Normal** and **Nerd** mode. Colors transition smoothly when switching modes, and the entire page animates using **Framer Motion**. Switching to Nerd mode triggers a glitch-style flicker effect and reveals a floating HUD with GitHub statistics.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at <http://localhost:5173> by default.
